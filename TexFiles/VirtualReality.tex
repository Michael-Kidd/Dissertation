\section {Oculus Rift}
The Virtual Reality headset we used for our project is an Oculus Rift, this is one of the top head mounted displays on the market. Along with the Rift, Oculus has also released two development kits before releasing the rift. They have released a mobile VR kit known as the Oculus Go. In spring 2019 Oculus will also release two more units, one known as the Rift S that will be similar to the Rift and one other unit known as the Oculus quest, which will be a stand alone unit that will not require a computer to operate. \newline

The Rift connects to a gaming graphics card with a HDMI port and a USB 3.0 connection for the head mounted display. The headset comes with two touch controllers and two external sensors that also each require a USB 3.0 connection. Due to the occlusion that occurs when using only two sensors, a third sensor is recommended for a much smoother experience. The position of the controllers and the headset in 3D space is captured using the external sensors.

\chapter{Methodology}
For the project we used the waterfall methodology. We started by mapping out the requirements for the project. Then we designed how the UI would be implemented, how the user should be able to add an account on the system.  We used GitHub for source control of the program, we also used overleaf for collaboration with the dissertation.

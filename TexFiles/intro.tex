\paragraph{Abstract}
(A brief description of what the project is, in about two-hundred and fifty words.) 
The goal of this project was to create a cross platform racing kart game that is playable on desktop, mobile and in virtual reality. The players will be able to compete against each other on all platforms. The game is played through a fully functional, and independently developed, back-end system that consists of 3 separate databases created using four different programming languages which together make up a large heterogeneous game hosting system. The system allows players, excluding mobile users (join only), to host or join online races. The game rules are traditional type where the first player to cross the finish line wins. The race results are then processed and displayed to screen and a global position/ranking is displayed to screen.

\chapter{Introduction}
This will be our intro RUFF DRAFT


For this project, we decided to create a "Mario Kart" style racing game 
with the capability of being played on both desktop and VR headset. The game was created using the Unity game engine with all the back-end support such as log-in, match making and scoring system hosted on a virtual server.

The game was created using C# language, log-in using java and Mongo DB,
match making used Go language with a Redis DB and the scoring system using python and a Maria DB. The reason for all of these was to show the heterogeneous capability of all of these component.

For this project, we decided to create a "Mario Kart" style racing game 
with the capability of being played on both desktop and VR headset. The game was created using the Unity game engine with all the back-end support such as log-in, match making and scoring system hosted on a virtual server. 

The game was created using C# language, log-in using java and Mongo DB,
match making used Go language with a Redis DB and the scoring system using python and a Maria DB. The reason for all of these was to show the heterogeneous capability of all of these component.

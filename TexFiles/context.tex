\chapter{Context}
The goal of our project is to create a system that allows users to play a video game using a mobile device, a computer or a virtual reality headset without distinction between the devices. A system that allows a user to pick up one of these devices and join a game that would contain multiple players using any combination of the previously mentioned devices.\newline

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a kart style racing game in virtual reality.
\item Create a kart racing game on a desktop gaming system.
\item Port the desktop version of the game and modify it to be played on a mobile device.
\item Create a heterogeneous back-end system that allows players to login, find active games to join, and keep a scoring system as a leader-board and method of player progression. These systems must act independently of the game, this would in theory, allow another game or system to be quickly retro fitted to the system and still function.
